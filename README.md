# RSSParsing
Simple website which parses page with RSS content and  passes it to Mercury API.
Used Bootstrap 4 because it's supported basically by all browsers.
PHP used because I'm comfortable with it, and it offers simple way of interracting with XML. Also, that topic is really well documented 
Heroku web app url is https://whispering-castle-73492.herokuapp.com/
